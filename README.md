Welcome to my Quiz App! ðŸŽ‰

Iâ€™m thrilled to share the completion of this interactive quiz application, built from the ground up as a personal project to showcase my full-stack development skills. This app allows users to engage with a variety of quiz topicsâ€”General Knowledge, Films, Music, and Televisionâ€”featuring a responsive design, dynamic progress tracking, and a user-friendly interface. Developed using Node.js, Express, EJS, and Sass, with axios for API integration, this project demonstrates my ability to:

Design and implement a front-end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Manage back-end logic and session handling.
Create a scalable, responsive layout adaptable to different devices.
Integrate and manipulate external data using the Open Trivia Database API for dynamic question sets.
This project is a testament to my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and passion for creating functional, user-centric applications. Feel free to explore the code, test the app, and provide feedback!
